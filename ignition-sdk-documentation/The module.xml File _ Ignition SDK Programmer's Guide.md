### Getting Started Anatomy of a Module The module.xml File

# **Version:** 8.3 The module.xml File

The module descriptor is an XML file included in the root of the module package that defines a variety of properties about the
```
modules. This file must always be named module.xml . The descriptor lists the JARs to be used and their scopes. It also defines the
```
minimum required platform version and the full path of the hook classes for each scope.

The module descriptor file can also define dependencies on other modules. For example, a module that adds components to Vision
```
will require the Vision module before it can be loaded. Below you will find the .modl file generated for our
AbstractTagDriverExample.modl :
```
module.xml
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<modules>
<module>
<id>com.inductiveautomation.ignition.examples.atd</id>
<name>AbstractTagDriver</name>

### TIP
```
If you are using an Ignition SDK Plugin to package your Module, then the module.xml file is automatically generated for you and
packed into the final .modl file. If you'd like to inspect the module file, uncompress your module using a zip tool (Winzip, StuffIt,
```
Winrar, etc.) and you will be able to view the auto-generated xml.

# Sub Elements

### Name Description Required? Attributes
```
id
```
The string identifier for the module. Must be unique across all

modules. Should be a "fully qualified name".

Yes n/a
```
name
The user-friendly name for this module.
Yes
n/a
requiredignitionversion
```
The version of Ignition required by the module. Versions have the
```
following syntax: major.minor.revision[-rcX][-betaX] .
```
Yes n/a
```
requiredframeworkversion
```
An integer indicating the framework version required. The

framework version number is incremented when the API changes in

a backwards-incompatible manner.

Yes n/a
```
</module>
</modules>

### Name Description Required? Attributes
```
hook
```
Specifies the entry point into a module, for each scope. Only one

should be listed per each of the three scopes.

Yes scope
```
version
```
The version of the module. Versions have the following syntax:
```
major.minor.revision[-rcX][-betaX] .
```
Additionally, the value "dev" is allowed, specifying that this is a

development version of the module. The "dev" version bypasses

most version equality checks, and may have unexpected

consequences. However, when testing features like redundancy, it

can be useful to get around stringent version matching.

Yes n/a
```
description
A description for the module.
No
n/a
license
```
Name of an HTML file to be found in the root level of the modl file.

Should define the license for the module. This is the license that a

user would agree to upon installing the module.

No n/a
```
documentation
```
Name of an HTML file that is the root of a user manual for the

module. If present, this file must be located under a folder named
```
"doc" in the modl file. Other HTML, image, and CSS files may be
```
located in this folder as well. These webpages will be mounted

when the module is installed.

No n/a

### Name Description Required? Attributes
```
depends
Specifies modules that this module depends on. The value is the id
of the required module. There can be at most one depends element
```
### for each scope. If the required attribute is set to true, the module

### will fault without the dependency being satisfied. If required is set to

### false (default), no warning will be logged if the dependency is not

satisfied.

No

scope,

required
```
jar
```
Specifies JAR files included in the module package that define the

module, or upon which the module depends.

All libraries, including those that comprise the module itself, should

have their own JAR entry. The main function of this element,

besides specifying which libraries to load, is to specify their scope.

This is important for instructing the system to send libraries through

the web launch system to clients and the designer, for example.

Conversely, it is important to prevent libraries from being sent to the

client when they are not necessary, as they will increase the

download size.

No scope, os
```
export
Similar to jar , in that it specifies a JAR file, but different in that the
```
JAR file will be loaded into a higher classloader, making it

accessible to other modules.

Two important notes about this element:

### Name Description Required? Attributes

Modules using exports will require a Gateway restart to modify

or uninstall.

This feature is only for the Gateway scope. Client and Designer

scopes do not maintain a classloader hierarchy like the

Gateway.
