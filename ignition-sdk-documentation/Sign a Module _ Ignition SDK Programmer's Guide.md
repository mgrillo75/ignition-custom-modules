### Getting Started Create a Module Sign a Module

# **Version:** 8.3 Sign a Module

An Ignition Module must be signed before it can be installed on a system that is not in developer mode.

Modules can be signed using either a real code signing certificate obtained from a Certificate Authority or using a self-generated and

self-signed certificate. What kind of certificate you use to sign your module depends on the level of assurance you want to offer your

end users. If you're building a module for internal use within your company, using a self-signed certificate may not be an issue. If

you're selling a module to other users of Ignition you should use a certificate obtained from a CA.

# Getting Started

What you'll need:

Code signing certificate.

The full certificate chain, in the correct order, in p7b (PKCS7) format.

### The IA module signing tool.

# Signing Your Module

Your certificate and its private key should be stored inside a Java keystore. You'll need this keystore file and the associated certificate

chain to run the module signing tool. The certificate will be stored under an alias and be password protected.
