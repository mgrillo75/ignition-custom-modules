Programming for the Gateway

# **Version:** 8.3 Programming for the Gateway

# Getting Started - The Module Hook
```
The first step to creating a Gateway scoped module is to create a GatewayModuleHook . This interface defines all of the functions that
```
Ignition expects a module entry point to have.

Although, because there aren’t many cases where you’ll need to define everything, you’ll almost always extend from
```
AbstractGatewayModuleHook .
```
In several cases, however, the module provides information to the platform by overriding functions in the module hook. For this
```
reason, it is useful to view the JavaDocs for GatewayModuleHook and acquaint yourself with the defined methods. These methods will
```
also be covered in the next few sections.

# Life-cycle Functions
```
When you extend from AbstractGatewayModuleHook , there are a few life cycle functions that must be implemented.
```
## setup(GatewayContext context)

The goal of this function is to give the module a chance to register objects with the platform, and prepare to run by defining anything

you need to start for your module to work. All code related to your module’s actual business logic will likely be in startup(), not setup().

At this stage, the modules that this module depends on (per the module.xml) will have been loaded, but you won't be able to rely on

any other modules having been loaded. Furthermore, many platform functions will not be available, so you shouldn't try to reach out to

other areas of Ignition much. You may query the internal database, but should not modify it. If you must modify data, wait until the

startup() phase.

### GatewayContext

The setup() function is provided a GatewayContext. This is the access point for the module to the rest of the system, and should be

stored by the module into a field for later use. GatewayContext is your module’s entrypoint to the rest of the Ignition platform, when

your module needs to reach out to some other subsystem. The GatewayContext instance you receive will be valid for the entire

lifetime of the gateway until the next restart, so you can safely use the same instance in any of your module’s methods.

## startup(LicenseState license)

Starts execution of the module. At this point the system is almost fully running, though some modules may be started after your

module. The LicenseState parameter contains details about the gateway’s license, and can be used if you want your module to work

during the trial period or only work under certain licensing terms.

## shutdown()

Called when the platform is shutting down, or the module is being removed/restarted.

**Important:** You should take special care to remove all resources added by the module to the platform. If any resource is left

uncollected, the entire module will remain in memory, leading to a memory leak, which will be particularly troublesome if the

module is reloaded several times in one gateway session.
